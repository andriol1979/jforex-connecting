# Create a Java server connecting to AWS S3 & MongoDB

Back-End Development Posted Feb 13, 2023
We need a small Java server created, which needs to connect to 3 services:
- A MongoDB server/cluster on Atlas
- To AWS S3
- To an API called jForex (https://www.dukascopy.com/client/javadoc3/)

The server would listen to events coming from the jForex API and have utility functions for calling MongoDB/S3.
It doesn't need to do anything with these services beyond connecting and performing a basic query/search operation.
I can provide some sample code for listening to events from the jForex API.

I'd like this project set up with Maven such that it's easy for me to manage dependencies in the future.
Lastly I'd like some documentation so I know how to set it up, preferably in Eclipse.
